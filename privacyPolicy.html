            <small class="pb-4">Last modified July 25, 2022</small>
            <p class="pb-3">
                Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before using our sites or services. 
                By accessing or using our site or our services. By clicking agree and continue 
                you agree to this privacy policy.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-4">
                This Privacy Policy tells you the types of information we collect when you 
                use our Sites or Services, how we use that information, and the instances in 
                which we can share your information.
            </p>
            <h5 class="pb-2">SUMMARY OF KEY PRINCIPLES</h5>
            <p class="my-0 ">
                To enhance, personalize, and support your experience on the Site, among 
                other things, we collect, use, and share your user information. For example, 
                we use aggregated information to develop content targeted to user interests 
                and to generally improve the Site's user experience.
            </p>
            <p class="my-0 ">
                We thought it would be helpful to set out briefly the key ways in which 
                we use your information and how we seek to protect privacy. Of course, 
                you should read the terms of our full Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p class="my-0 ">
                We typically collect two kinds of information about you: 
                (a) information that you provide that personally identifies you 
                (e.g., full name or phone number); and (b) information that does not personally
                identify you (e.g., your IP address or type of browser).
            </p>
            <p class="my-0 ">
                - This information is transmitted to, held and processed by us.

            <p class="my-0 ">
                - Through the use of "cookies", we work with and permit advertising networks to 
                collect anonymous information about you to send you their ads and use the same 
                information to send you our ads (see section III below).

                - We encrypt some information you input using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 
                software and take reasonable security measures to safeguard information.

            <h5 class="pb-2">COOKIES AND PREFERENCE BASED ADVERTISING.</h5>
            <p class="pb-2">
                (a) Cookies and Web Beacons: We and the third parties we authorize automatically 
                receive and store certain types of non-PII whenever you interact with us by using 
                "cookies" and analogous technology. "Cookies" are small files that are placed on your 
                computer or your internet browser memory to enable the owner of the cookie to recognize 
                your browser and to provide convenience and other features to you. So, for example, our 
                cookies may allow us to show you the past products you have searched for on our Sites. 
                It is important to note that the cookies that we use, or permit others to use, do not 
                contain and are not tied to PII about you.
                You may be able to direct your internet browser not to allow cookies 
                and you can typically delete existing cookies from your computer at any time. 
                Please note, however, some elements of our Sites will not function properly or be 
                available to you.
            </p>
